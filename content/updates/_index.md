## 2024 

* **22 August, 2024:** Long-overdue life update: I started my Ph.D. at the [University of Florida](https://stat.ufl.edu/) *(posted on 19 December, 2024)*.

* **01 April, 2024:** I left Canada after six years; Toronto, you'll be dearly missed. I look forward to what future holds. 

## 2023

* **05-10 August, 2023:** I'll attend [JSM2023](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2023/) at the Metro Toronto Conventional Center. Happy to connect and chat about alignment (or simply have a coffee) with everyone there! 

* **30 May, 2023:** I'll present my [research poster](./COVID_poster.pdf) at the [SSC Annual Meeting in Ottawa](https://ssc.ca/en/meetings/annual/2023-ssc-annual-meeting-ottawa). Come check it out if you're around, and let's chat!
