<div style='text-align: justify'>
I'm particularly drawn to a field known as Bayesian statistics, which offers a fertile and solid mathematical underpinnings for the development of many computational and statistical modeling ideas. For now,  my interests encompass the following areas: 
<br><br>
</div>

* Interpretability, efficiency, scalability, and robustness of approximate inference.

* Statistical inference in non-traditional settings (e.g., uncertainty quantification in non-i.i.d. settings, sensitivity of posterior inference subject to data perturbation, statistics on non-Euclidean space, etc.)

* Bayesian machine learning

I'm also open to learning more about 

* Hierarchical, mixture and graphical models.

* Optimal transport and statistical inference

* Combinatorial optimization

* Non-parametric and distribution free statistics
