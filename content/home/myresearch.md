I am particularly drawn to a field known as Bayesian statistics, which offers a fertile and solid mathematical underpinnings for the development of many computational and statistical modeling ideas. For now,  my interests encompass the following areas:

<li> Interpretability, efficiency, scalability, and robustness of approximate posterior inference </li>

<li> How we can quickly, easily, and reliably quantify uncertainty and robustness in modern data analysis procedures and make inference fast and easy to use for practitioners.  </li>
