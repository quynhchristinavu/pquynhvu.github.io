I am particularly drawn to a field known as Bayesian statistics, which offers a fertile and solid mathematical underpinnings for the development of many computational and statistical modeling ideas. For now,  my interests encompass the following areas:

I'm also open to learning more about 

* Hierarchical, mixture and graphical models.
