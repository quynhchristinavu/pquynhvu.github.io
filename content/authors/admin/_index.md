<div style='text-align: justify'>
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida. Prior to joining UFL, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Canada. In my research I develop statistical methods that address theoretical and computational challenges in settings where traditional statistical methods are insufficient. In my past life, I had conducted research on Markov Chain Monte Carlo, agent-based modeling, and variational Bayes.
<br/>
Non-academic-wise, I am really passionate about improving statistical communication and statistical literacy in the general populace, as well as increasing the representation of women in STEM and other quantitative fields. Outside of work, I really enjoy reading, crocheting, and hiking, and I am also a coffee enthusiast!
