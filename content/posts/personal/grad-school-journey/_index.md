I wasn’t expected to make it this far, and I'd never have envisioned myself as a Ph.D. student. As I entered college, I had no formal mentors to introduce me to the possibility of pursuing independent research through graduate training. But here I am, just wrapping up my first semester in the PhD program; while many things went better than expected, I also made quite a few mistakes.

## Undergraduate - Where the journey begins

<div style='text-align: justify' font-family: "Garamond", serif;>
My research journey began at my alma mater, York University, where, as a Specialized Honours student under <a href="https://madras.mathstats.yorku.ca/">Dr. Neal Madras</a>, I studied Metropolis–Hastings algorithm in the case of  the bounded, monotone-decreasing affine permutations. I honed my expertise in MCMS methods, validating the conjecture about the undistorted parallelism and the weak limits of the probability measures of these specific classes of affine permutations, which established the framework for pattern recognition in algorithm analysis. 
<br><br>
In the summer prior to my senior year, I worked with <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/professor/imoyles/">Dr. Iain Moyles</a> to study the potency of non-pharmaceutical interventions in curbing COVID-19 pathogenic transmission. I drew upon the compartmental SEIR model to simulate epidemics and employed MAP estimation framework for estimating SEIR-type models.

## M.Sc. - Time to narrow down my seemingly eclectic and vague interests

My time at the University of Toronto was really affirmative. Here, I focused my studies on probabilistic modelling and the trade-off between the computational complexity of an algorithm and the guarantees of asymptotically exact samples it may yield. This sparked my curiosity in how to use of probability language to automatically and coherently account for uncertainty. 
<br><br>
My research experience under Dr. Samantha-Jo Caetano further facilitating efficient and reliable data analysis procedures, I seek to aid researchers and practitioners in overcoming biases and turning data into actionable insights for better research. 


as it allowed me to realize how my seemingly vague 
interest in understanding uncertainty in inference problems fits together in one research area called Bayesian statistics.
