## Undergraduate

My research journey began at my alma mater, York University, where, as a Specialized Honours student under Dr. Neal Madras, I studied the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm in the case of  the bounded, monotone-decreasing affine permutations. I honed my expertise in MCMS methods, validating the conjecture about the undistorted parallelism and the weak limits of the probability measures of these specific classes of affine permutations, which established the framework for pattern recognition in algorithm analysis.

In the summer prior to my senior year, I worked with Dr. Iain Moyles to study the potency of non-pharmaceutical interventions in COVID-19 curbing pathogenic transmission. I drew upon the compartmental SEIR model to simulate epidemics and employed MAP estimation framework for estimating SEIR-type models.

## M.Sc. - Time to narrow down my seemingly disparate and vague interests


## Ph.D. - Piecing it together

## The future
