## Undergraduate - Where the journey begins

<div style='text-align: justify' font-family: "Garamond", serif;>
My research journey began at my alma mater, York University, where, as a Specialized Honours student under <a href="https://madras.mathstats.yorku.ca/">Dr. Neal Madras</a>, I studied Metropolis–Hastings algorithm in the case of  the bounded, monotone-decreasing affine permutations. I honed my expertise in MCMS methods, validating the conjecture about the undistorted parallelism and the weak limits of the probability measures of these specific classes of affine permutations, which established the framework for pattern recognition in algorithm analysis. 
<br>
In the summer prior to my senior year, I worked with <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/professor/imoyles/">Dr. Iain Moyles</a> to study the potency of non-pharmaceutical interventions in curbing COVID-19 pathogenic transmission. I drew upon the compartmental SEIR model to simulate epidemics and employed MAP estimation framework for estimating SEIR-type models.

## M.Sc. - Time to narrow down my seemingly eclectic and vague interests


## Ph.D. - Piecing it together

## The future
