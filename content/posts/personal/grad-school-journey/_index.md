I wasn’t expected to make it this far, and I'd never have envisioned myself as a Ph.D. student. As I entered college, I had no formal mentors to introduce me to the possibility of pursuing independent research through graduate training. But here I am, just wrapping up my first semester in the PhD program; while many things went better than expected, I also made quite a few mistakes.

## Undergraduate - Where the journey begins

<div style='text-align: justify' font-family: "Garamond", serif;>
My research journey began at my alma mater, York University, where, as a Specialized Honours student under Dr. Neal Madras, I studied Metropolis–Hastings algorithm in the case of  the bounded, monotone-decreasing affine permutations. I honed my expertise in MCMS methods, validating the conjecture about the undistorted parallelism and the weak limits of the probability measures of these specific classes of affine permutations, which established the framework for pattern recognition in algorithm analysis.

In the summer prior to my senior year, I worked with Dr. Iain Moyles to study the potency of non-pharmaceutical interventions in curbing COVID-19 pathogenic transmission. I drew upon the compartmental SEIR model to simulate epidemics and employed MAP estimation framework for estimating SEIR-type models.

## M.Sc. - Time to narrow down my seemingly eclectic and vague interests

My time at the University of Toronto was really affirmative. There, I focused on probabilistic modelling and the trade-off between the computational complexity of an algorithm and the guarantees of asymptotically exact samples it may yield. This sparked my curiosity in how to use probability language to automatically and coherently account for uncertainty.

Under Dr. Samantha-Jo Caetano, I explored and quantified the differential COVID-19 latent mortality risks by Toronto neighborhoods and demographic statuses, modeling the age effect as a first-order random walk and parametrizing residency-based variation using the Gaussian distribution. Further, I worked with Dr. Luai Al-Labadi to derive a new Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based model-validation technique that is robust to both uncensored and right-censored data, using the Beta-Stacy process as the prior.
<br><br>
The research I had conducted thus far not only allowed me to accrue considerable insights into inferential challenges of modern data analysis procedures but also to realize how my interests fit together under the umbrella of <b> Bayesian statistics</b>. 

## Ph.D. - Piecing it together

believing in me and taking a chance on a student who knew so little but dreamed of
doing so much. Were it not for each of you, I may never have pursued a Ph.D. in the
first place. Thank you for everything that you’ve done for me.


## The future

I plan to lead my own research group, either in academia or industry, and continue to advance the reliability and efficiency of data-informed decision-making across all domains. 
further facilitated efficient and reliable data analysis procedures, I seek to aid researchers and practitioners in overcoming biases and turning data into actionable insights for better research. 


This enables me to make connections and contributions to the ongoing research efforts on the foundational and algorithmic advances for reliable and automatic prediction mechanisms
